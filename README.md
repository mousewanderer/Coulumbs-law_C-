# Coulombs-law_C++

A simple program that calculates Coulomb’s Law.  
Originally made in C# to assist with general physics coursework.  
Takes user inputs for charge values and distance, then outputs the calculated force using the Coulomb’s Law formula.

## Formula
F = k * (q1 * q2) / r²  
Where:  
- F is the electrostatic force (Newtons)  
- k is Coulomb’s constant (8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²)  
- q1 and q2 are the charges (Coulombs)  
- r is the distance between charges (meters)

## Features
- Accepts charge values and distance as input
- Calculates electrostatic force
- Displays the Coulomb’s Law formula and computed result
- Simple console interface
